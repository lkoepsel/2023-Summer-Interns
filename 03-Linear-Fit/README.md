# 03 Linear Fit

Combining elements from the first two projects, this notebook will: 

- allow input of labels for the graph, x-axis and y-axis
- take a user-input list of (x,y) pairs
- allow selection of a subset of the values (specifying x<sub>min</sub> and x<sub>max</sub>)
- perform a linear fit to the selected range of data
- plot the following on one graph: 
 	- the original values as points (one color)
	- the selected values as points (another color)
	- the line corresponding to the fit over the selected range (as.. a line)
- display the results of the linear fit (slope and intercept)

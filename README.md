# 2023-Summer-Interns

Working repository for development of Physical Science compute projects using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

This is a .git repository, read more [here](git.md).

Notes and documents are formatted using Markdown. For more about Markdown, see [here](markdown.md).

## Template for Assignments
The structure of each assignment will be the same and will have the following format:
(*Note the markdown associated with each title/subtitle.*)
# Title 
Title matches the title of the assignment. Under the title, *copy/paste* the same text as the assignment.
## Algorithm
A numerical list of steps which need to happen to accomplish the objectives of the assignment.
## Program 
Take each algorithm step and divide them into two cells, one *Markdown* which is the step description and the other is *Python*, which is the code which accomplishes the step.

## Example Physics Labs

- [Physics Calculations and Use of Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BORHZHp9vZx8VRpsASbxAk6wUJTaDzGujFN3lA310oQ/edit?usp=sharing), simple calculations, graphing tabular data, graphing a function

- [Physical Measurements & Error Analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sa4lpI5kSxpxDpPUolyCu62tIIh2jlwC5H5JW26uh7Y/edit?usp=sharing), simple calculations, mean and stdev

- [Accelerated Motion in 1-Dimension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UI_NVD_b9sYbQM7GLs_zIqasroRZSweN0DmHiOZeG7A/edit?usp=drive_link), using [this google sheet](http://tinyurl.com/p3a-acceleration), users input position data, calculate and graph velocity vs time, and extract slopes to measure acceleration

- [Hookeâ€™s Law & Centripetal Force] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Q72c0yv2VCq9q-nX88rzoLTGM2wACBiXR3dopmnfD4/edit?usp=sharing) Part A: calculations and graphing of tabular input data, linear fit to determine slope. Part B: tabular calculations (variety of functions)

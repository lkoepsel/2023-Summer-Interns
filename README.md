# 2023-Summer-Interns

Working repository for development of Physical Science compute projects using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

This is a .git repository, read more [here](git.md).

Notes and documents are formatted using Markdown. For more about Markdown, see [here](markdown.md).

## Template for Assignments
The structure of each assignment will be the same and will have the following format:
(*Note the markdown associated with each title/subtitle.*)
# Title 
Title matches the title of the assignment. Under the title, *copy/paste* the same text as the assignment.
## Algorithm
A numerical list of steps which need to happen to accomplish the objectives of the assignment.
## Program 
Take each algorithm step and divide them into two cells, one *Markdown* which is the step description and the other is *Python*, which is the code which accomplishes the step.

# Average Calc

This notebook will take as input a (variable length) list of values from the user. An editable table for the input values would be nice for legibility.

The following should be calculated and clearly displayed:
- the number of values supplied
- the mean of the values
- the standard deviation of the values

BONUS: nicely formatted LaTex displays of the formulas used for mean, stdev
